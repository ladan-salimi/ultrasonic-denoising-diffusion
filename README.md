# ultrasonic-denoising-diffusion
Speckle noise has long been known as a limiting factor for the quality of an ultrasound image. In this code, anisotropic
diffusion filtering is applied as an effective method for ultrasound speckle reduction. In this code, 2 filters
are implemented in python. For each filter, a noisy images with speckle noise are tested. The results
show that anisotropic filter can reduce the noise more effectively than 3D filter
